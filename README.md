## Smart Contracts 📝

The smart contracts in the `contracts/` directory form the backbone of the Swaps-Certificate system. They are written in Solidity and ensure the secure handling of certificate data.

### Key Contracts

- **Lock.sol:**  
  - Serves as an introductory contract for setting up Hardhat.
  - Provides basic functionality, such as locking and unlocking values, useful for initial testing.

- **Upload.sol:**  
  - Manages the upload and registration of certificates.
  - Interacts with IPFS by storing file hashes on the blockchain, ensuring certificate authenticity and immutability.
  - Contains functions for adding, verifying, and retrieving certificate details.

### Deployment & Interaction

- **Deployment 🚀:**  
  - Utilizes the `scripts/deploy.js` script to deploy contracts to both local and test networks (e.g., Goerli).
  - Deployed contracts expose functions that can be invoked by the frontend or backend for certificate operations.

- **Interaction 🔗:**  
  - Frontend components and backend services communicate with these contracts via libraries like web3.js or ethers.js, ensuring seamless blockchain interactions.

---

## Frontend 🎨

The frontend, developed with React.js, offers an interactive and user-friendly interface for all certificate-related operations.

### Key Components and Files

- **App.js:**  
  - The entry point for the React application.
  - Sets up routing, state management, and context providers.

- **VerifyCertificate.js:**  
  - Provides functionality to fetch and display certificate details.
  - Uses blockchain data to verify the authenticity of certificates by comparing on-chain and off-chain information.

- **CreateCertificate.js:**  
  - Allows authorized users to create and issue certificates.
  - Collects certificate details, uploads files to IPFS, and interacts with smart contracts to register the certificate.

- **Blockchain.js:**  
  - Handles blockchain interactions such as connecting to the Ethereum network, reading smart contract data, and sending transactions.

- **ipfs.js:**  
  - Contains utility functions for uploading certificate files to IPFS.
  - Ensures that file hashes are stored on the blockchain for verification purposes.

- **BlockchainContext.js:**  
  - Implements React Context to share blockchain-related state and methods across components.
  - Simplifies access to blockchain data without prop drilling.

### User Experience Enhancements

- **Responsive Design 📱:**

## Backend 🔌

The backend, built with Node.js and Express, acts as the bridge between the frontend and the blockchain, handling API requests and additional business logic.

### Core Responsibilities

- **API Endpoints 📡:**  
  - Offers endpoints for creating, retrieving, and verifying certificates.
  - Supports operations such as user authentication, certificate data retrieval, and transaction tracking.

- **Middleware 🔍:**  
  - Custom middleware for request validation, authentication, and logging.
  - Ensures that only authorized users can access sensitive endpoints.

- **Server Configuration ⚙️:**  
  - The `server.js` file initializes the Express server, sets up routes, and manages error handling.
  - Provides a modular structure that allows for easy expansion and maintenance.

### Blockchain Communication

- **Integration 🔗:**  
  - Uses libraries like web3.js or ethers.js to interact with deployed smart contracts.
  - Acts as an intermediary for executing smart contract functions on behalf of the frontend, thus abstracting complexity.

- **Data Aggregation 📊:**  
  - Collates data from both the blockchain and IPFS, ensuring that certificate information is consistent and verified.

## Testing ✅

Robust testing is integral to ensuring the reliability and security of the Swaps-Certificate system.

### Smart Contract Testing

- **Location 📂:**  
  - Test scripts are located in the `test/` directory.
- **Execution 🏃‍♂️:**  
  - Run all tests using Hardhat:
    ```sh
    npx hardhat test
    ```
- **Coverage 📈:**  
  - Tests cover various scenarios including successful certificate registration, verification, and edge cases.

### Frontend & Backend Testing

- **Frontend:**  
  - While primary tests focus on contracts, unit and integration tests using Jest or React Testing Library can be implemented to ensure component reliability.
- **Backend:**  
  - Mocha and Chai can be used for writing tests for API endpoints and middleware, ensuring secure and correct data handling.
